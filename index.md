My name is **Ramin Firoozye**.

I am a technologist, communicator, and enthusiastic, lifelong builder. I also like thinking about hard problems, innovation, and bringing people together.

My friend [Joe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeisner/) told me years ago that nobody reads resumes any more. That portfolios with pictures are the best way to show people what you've done. I've been a big believer and have recommended it to any engineer or manager I've met since.

You can be the judge.

The links on the left side-bar will show some of the work I've done over the course of my (completely unplanned) career.

I am based out of the San Francisco Bay Area, where I live with my wife and two boys. My pronouns are he/him.

If you have projects that might be of interest, feel free to reach out via the social media links or direct contacts in my resume.

Thank you!
