GoalKeeper was built for Procter & Gamble to help engage and retain the core 18-24 year-old audience of their popular *Being Girl* site. Users could track their goals, post journal entries, and invite friends and family to become supporters.

GoalKeeper featured a progress tracking Flash widget for embedding in Facebook or MySpace pages, RSS feeds for journals, and an animated scrapbook that could be e-mailed to supporters by way of thanks when the goal was achieved.

The system was built based on the *Palchemy* custom social networking framework.
