Designed and developed native iOS SDK and Javascript library for *eMagazines Insight* â€” a marketing analytics service that allows digital magazine publishers to connect email and web-marketing campaigns all the way through app installation, in-app purchasing, and user analytics. Delivered full SDK, examples, sample apps, and developer documentation and tutorials.

Javascript version integrated with Adobe DPS service and InDesign CS. Technology has been adopted by over 90% of digital magazine publishers in the market. Both versions used local SQLite-based on-device cache to allow seamless offline use. 

Featured on Adobe Developer Connection: *Measure app promotion success by Campaign ID*.
