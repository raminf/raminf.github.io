WizCard supported multiple cards, each with their own visual design linked to profile data. 

Cards could be selected from an animated carousel beamed via Bluetooth or WiFi to other iPhones or e-mailed to desktop users. WizCard could also record contextual reminders about the card exchange via GPS, camera, and notes.

In addition to standard contact info, cards could be tied to social networking profiles from Google, LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter.
