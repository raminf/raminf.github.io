Onewheel is a self-balancing one-wheeled electric skateboard. Following a successful Kickstarter Campaign the device was designed and manufactured domestically.

Both iOS and Android Apps were developed as a virtual dashboard for the device, allowing monitoring of dozens of attributes such as power, motor, accelerometer, distance, etc. via Bluetooth Low-Energy, embeddable SDK, and custom firmware protocol. The app can also switch ride-modes (much like a carâ€™s transmission) to adjust speed and self-balancing settings.
