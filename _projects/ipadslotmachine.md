iPad Slot Machine used four iPads and an iPhone, connected wirelessly via WiFi, to simulate a slot machine. 

Three iPads were used for each reel and a fourth for the coin slot. The iPhone, through its accelerometer, acted as a virtual ‘pull handle.’ It was used to show off features of the newly released iPad and made use of many advanced iOS technologies.

iPad Slot Machine was a team effort developed during a 36 hour period as part of the 2010 iPadDevCamp hackathon. It won the *Coolest App* award and was featured in **USA Today**.
