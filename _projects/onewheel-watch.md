Onewheel is a self-balancing one-wheeled electric skateboard. Following a successful Kickstarter Campaign the device was designed and manufactured domestically.

The Watchkit app was developed in cooperation with Apple to launch on the first day of its public release. The app showed realtime speed and battery levels and allowed users to turn on/off the lights and change ride modes directly from the Apple Watch without having to take out the phone.
