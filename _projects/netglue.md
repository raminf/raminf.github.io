NetGlue was designed to simplify the process of creating web-services. 

It turned individual web-sites and applications into *plug-in* components that could be connected to each other via XML flows.

It also offered a simple pipeline toolkit to simplify the process of connecting networked components and filtering and processing data without having to write any code. A custom XML and XSLT parser was developed to enable this.
