The application used a visual workflow to help users self-diagnose problems and improve their health through better nutrition and exercise. 

It also allowed users to track their medications (and check against drug interactions), discover alternative treatments, shop for cheapest drugs, securely communicate with their doctors, and collect diagnostics at home and transmit the results to their health provider.

A functioning prototype was built and shown to various healthcare providers, corporations, public health policy experts, and HMOs. 

The consensus (in early 2000's) was that integration with existing healthcare IT infrastructure and regulatory issues would present insurmountable barriers.
