AutoPark kept track of time left on a parking meter and sent warning alarms to help avoid parking tickets. Users could also locate parked cars using the builtin GPS, keep track of the parking spot in a multistory lot, find nearby local services (i.e. gas stations, bathrooms, and banks) with one tap, and share parking data via e-mail.
