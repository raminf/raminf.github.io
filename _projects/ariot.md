Designed and developed an Augmented Reality application that would identify a connected IOT device (via bar-code) and present live sensor data in a floating 3D layer on top of the device. Proof-of-concept to demonstrate use of hand-free AR systems for industrial, repair, and home automation scenarios.

System was demonstrated at talk given at re:invent 2019:
