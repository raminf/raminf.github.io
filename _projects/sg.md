Worked with Light and Wonder (formerly Scientific Games) and hardware-design partner Reach Technologies to develop a cloud-based connected device platform. Developed software and hardware simulators, cloud-based services, mobile apps, and web-based dashboards.

Server-side analytics helped company determine what features to add to product. Diagnostic data from devices sent to the cloud helped reduce service calls and increase utilization.
