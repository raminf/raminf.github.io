Runabout predated Flash and DHTML and was the first browser to feature built-in scalable vector graphics and support for animation, audio, and video. 

It was based on a superset of HTML called *ANML* (Animation Markup Language) used to display highly interactive fullscreen experiences during a time when all other browsers were limited to showing static JPEG or GIF files.

The rendering engine was designed to be embeddable in CD and DVD-based games to allow seamless extension into web-based content.

The company was acquired by Microsoft shortly before product release.
